<title>dependency injection</title>
</head><body>One responsibility for a high-level client object could be to resolve its own dependencies by requesting the specific instances of the types that it needs. It's said that they adopt a pull model. The pull model means that the high-level client class has a dependency on the class that is responsible for creating or locating the object it wants to use.<br/>
<br/>
Dependency injection takes the opposite approach, adopting a push model in place of the pull model. With dependency injection, another class is responsible for injecting (pushing) the dependencies into the high-level client classes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Inversion of Control</i>&nbsp;is a term thatâ€™s often used to describe this push model and dependency injection is one specific implementation of the inversion of control technique.<br/>
